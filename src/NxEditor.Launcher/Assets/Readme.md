### Help & Information

**NxE**, short for **N**intendo E**x**tended **E**ditor, is a general purpose editor for various Nintendo file formats.
                        
While the plugin system can support any file format, **NxE** primarily aims to support the files from [Tears of the Kingdom](https://zelda.nintendo.com/tears-of-the-kingdom/) and more modern Nintendo Switch (NX) games.

#### Plugins

NXE was designed to be as expandable as possible, so a plugin system was devised.

This means that no file format is directly supported by **NxE**, but by an installed plugin.

Plugins can be developed by anyone, but **NxE** provides several official plugins with support for the most common file formats.

Official plugins are listed on the left of the launcher page and can be enabled or disabled based on your use case.

Note: '[EPD Plugin](https://github.com/NX-Editor/NxEditor.EpdPlugin)' is required for nearly all of the supported formats. Make sure it is **enabled** unless you have a specific reason not to.
